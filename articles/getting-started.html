<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p><code>cogxwalkr</code> is an R package designed to facilitate
crosswalking—or translating effect estimates—between different cognitive
outcome measures in studies of cognitive aging, exposures, and
interventions. It enables researchers to compare results across studies
that use different cognitive tests.</p>
<p>This package implements methods described in <span class="citation">(Ackley et al. 2025)</span>. The manuscript authors
developed two methods to crosswalk estimated treatment effects of
cognitive outcomes that are flexible, broadly applicable, work when only
summary statistics are available, and do not rely on strong
distributional assumptions. This method requires access to a dataset
that includes both the cognitive measure you wish to crosswalk from and
the cognitive measure you wish to crosswalk to.</p>
<p>The package was developed by Sarah Ackley and Jason Gantenberg. This
vignette demonstrates how to use cogxwalkr in R.</p>

<p>To install the package, you will first need to install and load the
remotes package, which you can do from the R console:</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#usage"></a>
</h2>
<p>As a motivating example, consider a study estimating the effect of
APOE-ε4 carrier status on scores from the MMSE (Mini-Mental State
Examination). If we wish to compare this effect to results from another
study that used the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), we need a
conversion factor that allows us to convert a summary measure on the
MMSE scale to the MoCA scale. <code>cogxwalkr</code> aids in estimating
the conversion coefficient required to crosswalk from the MMSE to the
MoCA.</p>

<h3 id="adjunct-data">Adjunct Data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adjunct-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>These crosswalk methods require individual-level data from an adjunct
study: a study where both cognitive measures are performed for each
participant. In this package, the built-in <code>cogsim</code> dataset
represents the adjunct study data. The adjunct data is simulated data
based on the <a href="https://adni.loni.usc.edu" class="external-link">Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative</a> (ADNI). This dataset includes an MMSE
(mini-mental status exam) score and MoCA (Montreal cognitive assessment)
score conditional on binary dementia status (0 for absent and 1 for
present) for approximately 1500 study participants. Code used to fit and
simulate these data can be found at <a href="github/jrgant/data-raw/cogsim.r"></a>.</p>

<p>Additional information is available via <code><a href="../reference/cogsim.html">?cogsim</a></code>.</p>
<p>We implement two methods to obtain crosswalk slopes: 1) unconditional
method and 2) conditional method. The unconditional method requires only
data on both cognitive measures for each individual, whereas the
conditional method requires additional data on a third binary variable,
here dementia status.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="unconditional-method">Unconditional Method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#unconditional-method"></a>
</h3>
<p>To obtain an estimate of the crosswalk slope using the unconditional
method we can use the crosswalk function, which is the workhorse of the
package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/crosswalk.html">crosswalk</a></span><span class="op">(</span>cog1 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"mmse"</span>, cog2 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"moca"</span>, data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">cogsim</span>, num_iter <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">500</span><span class="op">)</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<p>This estimates a crosswalk slope from <code>cog1</code>, here the
MMSE, to <code>cog2</code>, here the MoCA, using the built-in cogsim
data as the adjunct data. <code>cog1</code> and <code>cog2</code> must
be supplied as strings. <code>niter</code> gives the number of random
splits used to obtain the crosswalk. The built-in <code>cogsim</code>
dataset can be replaced with any other dataset containing the
appropriate columns. Since this uses the adjunct data without any
bootstrap resampling, no uncertainty on the crosswalked slope is
presented.</p>

</h4>
<p>The unconditional method can also be used based only on summary
statistics. (In many cases, it may be more statistically efficient to do
so, as the number of unconditional split iterations must be chose with
care.)</p>
<p>The summary statistics approach is accessible directly via the
<code><a href="../reference/crosswalk.html">est_cw_coef()</a></code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/crosswalk.html">est_cw_coef</a></span><span class="op">(</span>cog1 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"mmse"</span>, cog2 <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"moca"</span>, data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">cogsim</span>, method <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"lm"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, we recommend using <code><a href="../reference/crosswalk.html">crosswalk()</a></code> because other
functions in <code>cogxwalkr</code> are built to act upon its output,
not that of <code><a href="../reference/crosswalk.html">est_cw_coef()</a></code>.</p>
<p>Omitting the <code>niter</code> argument when calling
<code><a href="../reference/crosswalk.html">crosswalk()</a></code> will result in the package using the “lm”
method to estimate the crosswalk:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="conditional-method">Conditional Method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conditional-method"></a>
</h4>
<p>To use the conditional method, we must specify an additional binary
variable on which to perform the conditional splits. The optional
<code>condition_by</code> input declares this input and, when present,
will elicit the conditional method. Note that <code><a href="../reference/crosswalk.html">crosswalk()</a></code>
will ignore <code>niter</code> if <code>condition_by</code> is
specified.</p>
